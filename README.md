# OOSA Assignment 2020

This contains the files needed for the 2020 OOSA assignment. LVIS data can be downloaded from [here](https://lvis.gsfc.nasa.gov/Data/Data_Download.html).  We will be using files from [Operation IceBridge](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/icebridge/index.html), which bridged the gap between ICESat and ICESat-2 using aircraft.
